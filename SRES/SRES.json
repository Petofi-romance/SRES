The top half of the image, with the text 'how school wifi is when ur in class' shows a happy and well-made crocheted or knitted Pikachu, symbolizing the Wi-Fi working well when you don't need it, i.e., when you're in class and perhaps not using it as much. \n The bottom half, with the text 'how school wifi is when you need it' shows a distorted and seemingly damaged Pikachu, representing the Wi-Fi when you actually need it, such as when you're trying to study or complete an assignment outside of class. \n The punchline here is the contrast between the Wi-Fi's performance when it's not needed versus when it's needed, suggesting that it's often more reliable when it's not being used for its intended purpose.    This is a playful commentary on the unpredictability and sometimes frustrating nature of school Wi-Fi."

This suggests that despite sleeping for an extended period in bed, SpongeBob still appears tired or unrefreshed.  \n In the bottom panel, SpongeBob is shown with a wide, energetic smile, holding a sandwich, and the text reads 'Sleeping 5 minutes on the couch. 'This implies that a short nap on the couch has left him feeling more refreshed and happy than a long sleep in bed.  \n The punchline of the meme is the contrast between the two scenarios, humorously suggesting that sometimes a short, unexpected rest can be more rejuvenating than a long, intended sleep.It plays on the common experience of feeling more awake and alert after a brief nap, especially if it's taken at an unconventional time or place."
